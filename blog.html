            <h2>Real Environmental Problem: Air Pollution in India</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>India faces a severe air pollution crisis, particularly in urban areas like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The <strong>Air Quality Index (AQI)</strong> in some cities often exceeds hazardous levels, causing significant health and environmental concerns.</p>
                <p>Key sources of air pollution in India include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicular emissions from an increasing number of vehicles.</li>
                    <li>Industrial emissions releasing sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).</li>
                    <li>Crop burning in northern states during the harvest season.</li>
                    <li>Construction dust from large-scale projects.</li>
                    <li>Firecrackers, especially during festivals like Diwali.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <h4>1. Health Risks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis.</li>
                    <li>Increased premature deaths from heart and lung diseases.</li>
                    <li>Higher rates of eye irritation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Economic Costs</h4>
                <p>The World Bank estimates that air pollution costs India over <strong>$95 billion annually</strong> in lost productivity and healthcare expenses.</p>

                <h4>3. Environmental Damage</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced crop yields due to ozone pollution.</li>
                    <li>Smog and haze reducing visibility and affecting daily life.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Impact on Children</h4>
                <p>Children’s developing lungs are particularly vulnerable, leading to stunted growth and reduced cognitive abilities.</p>
